# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description
This project introduces the basics of asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. It focuses on creating asynchronous coroutines, managing concurrent tasks, and applying random delays with type annotations and full documentation compliance.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python 3.7
- PEP8 style (pycodestyle 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- Each file must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Proper documentation is required for modules and functions
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Project Structure
- **0-basic_async_syntax.py**: Contains `wait_random`, an asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` seconds.
- **0-main.py**: Simple script to test the functionality of `wait_random`.

## Usage
```bash
$ chmod +x 0-main.py
$ ./0-main.py
```
